# Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor** in **Verilog HDL**.  
It follows the **RV32I** instruction set and executes all instructions in a single clock cycle.

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
âœ… Designed using **Verilog HDL**  
âœ… Simulated using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog) & GTKWave**  
âœ… Developed in **VS Code**  

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Implements a **Single-Cycle RISC-V Core**.
- Supports **basic RV32I instructions** (Integer Arithmetic, Load/Store, Branch, and Jump).
- Fully synthesizable design.
- Simulated and verified using testbenches.

NOTE:
1)Byte Addressable Architecture
2)In this we always delas with words so endianess is invisible in this RTL Design
3)
